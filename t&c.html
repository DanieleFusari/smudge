        <h2>WWW.Smudgenatural.COM ("WEBSITE"). </h2>
        <p>Smudge provides the content and services available on the Website to you subject to the following terms and conditions ("Terms and Conditions"). By accessing or using the Website, you are acknowledging that you have read, understand, and agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. </p>

        <h3>Purchase Contract:</h3>
        <p>This web site is operated by Smudge ("we", "us" or "our"). All purchases made on this web site are governed by these Terms and Conditions at any time although the Terms and Conditions governing any given purchase will be those in effect at the date of your order. If you order goods after we have published the changes you will be bound by those changes. Accordingly, you should check prior to each order to ensure that you understand the precise terms and conditions applicable to your purchase. To assist you in determining whether the Terms and Conditions have changed since your most recent order we will display the date when these Terms and Conditions were most recently updated.</p>
        <p>We will confirm acceptance of your order. This will occur after you have confirmed your order by us sending an e-mail to the email address you have provided to us. At this point the purchase contract will be made and we will supply the goods to you in accordance with your order and these Terms and Conditions.</p>

Smudge reserves the right to cancel any order for any reason. You must also check the items once they arrive to see if they are the correct order before opening the products.</p>

        <h3>Prices:</h3>
        <p>All prices are in UK Pounds and are inclusive of VAT where applicable, at the current rate.

If you subsequently amend your order, the prices charged will be those applicable to the amended item(s) at the time that the amended order is confirmed. Please note that as promotions are offered for a limited period of time subsequent amendments to your order may mean that certain promotions are no longer being offered.</br>
